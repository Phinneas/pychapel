===========================================
pych - The Python/Chapel integration module
===========================================

pyChapel provides interoperability with Chapel in three forms:

1. Chapel code inlined in Python
2. Chapel code from source-files
3. Compile Chapel modules into Python modules

The docs can be read from beginning to end. If you want a bit of motivation and
see what you might gain by familiarizing yourself with ``pyChapel`` then jump to the :ref:`sec-usage-examples` and :ref:`sec-usage` and take a look.
